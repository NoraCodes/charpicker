<h1>Rofi Charpicker</h1>

<p>A simple, fast, and keyboard-centric way to pick emoji, kaomoji, and special characters
under X and Wayland.</p>

<h2>Installing Charpicker</h2>

<p>You need to have <code>rofi</code> and <code>xdotool</code>. <code>rofi</code> handles selection and <code>xdotool</code> actually
enters the characters.</p>

<p>Then simply clone or download the repository and point a keyboard shortcut (I use Super+I)
at the script.</p>

<h2>Using Charpicker</h2>

<p>You simply type a search into the Rofi search bar. Some conveniences are provided such
as <code>gi</code> for ι and <code>gI</code> for Ι (and similar for other Greek letters).</p>

<p>You can add modifiers like gender and skin tone with provided sequences. For instance,
"child" gives 🧒, while "child" "+ female" gives 🧒‍♀️ and "child" "+ medium-light
skin tone" gives 🧒‍🏼.</p>
